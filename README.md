📖 About the Project

The Job Tracker is a full-stack web application designed to help users manage and track job applications throughout the hiring process.

Users can add job applications, update their status (Applied, Interview, Offer, Rejected), filter applications by status, and delete entries when needed. The application focuses on clean UI, responsive design, and smooth user interaction.

This project was built to simulate a real-world workflow and demonstrate practical frontend and backend development skills.
